# DNS-Packet-Injection
DNS packet injector capture the traffic from a network interface in promiscuous mode, and attempt to inject forged responses to selected DNS A requests. The DNS poisoning attack detector detects DNS poisoning attack attempts, such as those generated by DNS packet injector.


 Usage:

    For Injection:

        dnsinject [-i interface] [-f hostnames] expression

        -i  Listen on network device <interface> (e.g., eth0). If not specified,
            listens on default interface.

        -f  List of IP address and hostname pairs specifying the hostnames to
            be hijacked. If '-f' is not specified, dnsinject forge replies for
            all observed requests with the local machine's IP address as an answer.

            <expression> is a BPF filter that specifies a subset of the traffic to be
            monitored. This option is useful for targeting a single or a set of particular
            victims

        e.g.     ./dnsinject -i eth0 -f attackfile ip src <ip >

    For Detection:
        dnsdetect [-i interface] [-r tracefile] expression

            -i  Listen on network device <interface> (e.g., eth0). If not specified,
                the program listen on default interface.

            -r  Read packets from <tracefile> (tcpdump format).

            <expression> is a BPF filter that specifies a subset of the traffic to be
            monitored.
        e.g.    ./dnsdetect -r submit.pcap
